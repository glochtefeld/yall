Yet Another `ls -l` tool. 

This isn't a particularly serious project, but I wanted to learn C++ and this kind of simple project is a good way to do that. 

Really, it's just `ls` or `dir` with fewer features, just the ones I typically use.

## Features
* List file and directory information from the command line!
* Supports any<sup>*</sup> path you throw at it!
* Sort by Date *or* Time? The possibilities are endless!
* You can't get this kind of functionality without a bunch of aliases!
* Increased productivity<sup>**</sup>!




*: Probably.

**: Probably not.
